# SQL-Projects

SQL for Data Analysis â€“ edX Completed: 2025
* Mastered writing complex SQL queries to extract, filter, and aggregate data from self-created or pre-created databases.
* Covered key concepts such as JOIN, GROUP BY, subqueries, database and table creation, views and window functions. 

Short description of each unit:

# Unit 1: Quering
    * Tables, Databases, Database Management Systems.
    *  SQL, SQLite, SELECT, LIMIT, OFFSET, WHERE, Comparisons, NOT, NULL, Pattern Matching, LIKE, Compound Conditions, Range Conditions, Ordering.
    *  Aggregate Functions, ROUND, DISTINCT.

# Unit 2: Relating
    * Relational Databases. 
    * Relationships: One-to-one, One-to-many, Many-to-many. 
    * Entity Relationship Diagrams. Keys: Primary Keys, Foreign Keys. 
    * Subqueries, IN.
    * Joins: INNER JOIN, Outer Joins, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, NATURAL JOIN. 
    * Sets: INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT. 
    * Groups: GROUP BY, HAVING.

# Unit 3: Designing
    * Schemas, Normalizing, Data Types, Storage Classes, Type Affinities.
    *  Table Constraints: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY. 
    * Column Constraints: CHECK, DEFAULT, NOT NULL, UNIQUE. 
    * Altering Tables: DROP TABLE, ALTER TABLE, ADD COLUMN, RENAME COLUMN, DROP COLUMN.

# Unit 4: Reading
    * Create, Read, Update, Delete.
    * INSERT INTO, CSVs, import, DELETE FROM.
    * Foreign Key Constraints.

    * CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW.
    * Common Table Expressions.
    * Views for Partitioning. Views for Securing.
    * Soft Deletions.

# Unit 6: Optimizing:
    * Indexes, CREATE INDEX.
    * EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN.
    * Covering Indexes, B-Trees, Partial Indexes, VACUUM, Concurrency, Transactions.
    * ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
    * BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK.
    * Race Conditions, Locks.

# Unit 7: Scaling:
    * Scalability.
    * MySQL: Integers, Strings, Dates, Times, Real Numbers, Floating-Point Imprecision, Fixed Precision, Altering Tables.
    * Stored Procedures.
